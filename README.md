The hardest part for our group was managing the branching and committing of our data to the main repository. We ran into significant issues when trying to commit large files, as GitHub didn't handle big saves well. After a lot of troubleshooting, we discovered that the solution was to break our changes into smaller chunks and commit smaller amounts of data at a time, which ultimately resolved the issue and allowed us to push our updates successfully.
Additionally, some of us found real challanges trying to use the transform functions of the code, which required a good amount of research for those who struggled (me).
